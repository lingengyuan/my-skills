Generate a valid Obsidian Bases (.base) YAML file.

Context you are given:
- title
- folder
- root_dir (outputs/<folder>/<title>/)

CRITICAL CONCEPTS (READ THIS FIRST):
- Obsidian Bases is a VIEW DEFINITION system, NOT a data storage format
- The .base file defines HOW to view existing markdown files, NOT the data itself
- Data is automatically read from markdown frontmatter properties in the sourced files
- NEVER include a "data:" section with hardcoded values
- The "rows" displayed in the view are the markdown files found in the sources directory
- This is like a saved database query, not a database table

**CRITICAL: Path Resolution in Obsidian Bases**
- sources paths are relative to the VAULT ROOT, not the .base file location
- Using "./" will scan the entire vault root, which is usually not what you want
- ALWAYS use the full path from vault root: "outputs/<folder>/<title>/"
- ALWAYS add file.inFolder() filter as a safety measure to restrict scope

**CRITICAL: File Format**
- Output MUST be YAML format, NOT JSON
- Do NOT use { } brackets, [ ] arrays, or "key": "value" JSON syntax
- Use YAML syntax with proper indentation and colons
- Do NOT include JSON-specific fields like "version", "type", "sources" (as array)

Hard Requirements:
- sources MUST be exactly (relative to VAULT ROOT):
  outputs/<folder>/<title>/
- Non-markdown files MUST be excluded
- Define at least one view of type "table"
- The view's "order" MUST include at least 6 column specifications
- MUST include file.inFolder() filter to ensure only files from the target directory are shown

Recommended Columns (for the view's "order" section):
- file.name
- file.path
- tags
- category
- created
- modified

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- DO NOT include a "data:" section
- DO NOT hardcode data values
- DO NOT manually create records or entries
- DO NOT treat this as a data storage file
- DO NOT use "./" as the sources path (it scans the entire vault)
- DO NOT output JSON format (must be YAML)
- DO NOT use "version", "type" fields at the top level

Rules:
- The base will only show markdown files from this case directory
- Do NOT include markdown text or explanations
- Output ONLY valid .base YAML
- All data comes from the frontmatter of markdown files in the sources directory

Required Output Format:
```yaml
sources: |
  include: outputs/<folder>/<title>/
  exclude:
    - "*.json"

filters:
  and:
    - 'file.ext == "md"'
    - file.inFolder("outputs/<folder>/<title>")

properties:
  category:
    displayName: 分类
  created:
    displayName: 创建时间
  modified:
    displayName: 修改时间

views:
  - type: table
    name: 文件列表
    order:
      - file.name
      - tags
      - category
      - created
      - modified
```
