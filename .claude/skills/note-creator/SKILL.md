# note-creator (Orchestrator Skill)

## Purpose
Given a short user prompt (and optional raw context), this skill MUST:

1) Classify intent and decide a minimal artifact plan (default: md only)
2) Select a destination folder and stable naming
3) Invoke underlying format skills with runtime context
4) WRITE all generated artifacts to disk following a strict contract

This skill is an ORCHESTRATOR.
Generating content without writing files is considered a FAILURE.

---

## Dependencies
This skill MUST delegate format correctness to:

- obsidian-markdown/SKILL.md
- json-canvas/SKILL.md
- obsidian-bases/SKILL.md

---

## Inputs
- user_prompt: a short sentence or paragraph describing what to record
- optional_context_files (optional): raw markdown or text provided by the user

---

## Output Contract

**CRITICAL: Output paths are relative to CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY (CWD)**
- The CWD when the skill is invoked is the base (e.g., `F:/Project/Obsidian/`)
- All outputs MUST be written to: `<cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/`
- DO NOT write to the skill's own directory
- When computing paths, always use the current working directory as the base

All outputs MUST be written to:

outputs/<folder>/<title>/
  - note.md (required)
  - diagram.canvas (optional)
  - table.base (optional)
  - meta.json (required)

Rules:
- <folder> MUST come from rules/folders.md
- <title> MUST follow rules/naming.rules.md
- Writing files is mandatory

---

## Algorithm (Strict Execution Checklist)

### 1) Read Inputs
- Read user_prompt
- Read any optional_context_files

### 2) Classify Intent
Produce a STRICT classification JSON according to rules/classify.intent.md.
The JSON MUST include:
- title
- folder
- diagram_type
- artifact_plan (must include "md")
- tags (3–8)
- properties (category, created, modified, source)

If the request is a COMPARISON and "base" is included, the JSON MUST ALSO include:
- base_mode = "comparison"
- comparison_items: an array of items to compare (slug + display_name + optional fields)

### 3) Compute Output Paths
- CRITICAL: Get the current working directory (CWD) first
- CWD is the directory where the user invoked the skill (e.g., `F:/Project/Obsidian/`)
- Compute all paths as relative to CWD:
  - root_dir    = <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/
  - note_path   = <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/note.md
  - canvas_path = <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/diagram.canvas
  - base_path   = <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/table.base
  - meta_path   = <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/meta.json
  - compare_dir = <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/compare/   (comparison only)

- When writing files, use these full paths or ensure you're in the CWD

### 4) Generate and WRITE note.md (MANDATORY)
- Invoke obsidian-markdown skill using templates/note.md.prompt
- The invocation MUST include runtime context:
  - title
  - folder
  - tags
  - properties
  - root_dir (<cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/)

- The generated markdown MUST be written to disk at:
  <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/note.md

### 5) Generate and WRITE diagram.canvas (CONDITIONAL)

- If "canvas" is present in artifact_plan:

  - Select ONE canvas layout template based on diagram_type
    and content intent:

    - If diagram_type == "sequence":
        - If the note intent is documentation, explanation,
          sharing, usage instructions, or public-facing content:
            -> use templates/canvas.sequence.compact.md
        - Otherwise (internal notes, debugging, design reasoning):
            -> use templates/canvas.sequence.detailed.md

    - If diagram_type == "flowchart":
        -> use templates/canvas.flowchart.md

    - If diagram_type == "artifact":
        -> use templates/canvas.artifact.md

    - If diagram_type == "architecture":
        -> use templates/canvas.architecture.md

    - If diagram_type == "none":
        -> DO NOT generate diagram.canvas
           (remove "canvas" from artifact_plan)

  - Invoke json-canvas skill using templates/canvas.prompt

  - The invocation MUST include runtime context:
    - title
    - folder
    - diagram_type
    - artifact_plan
    - root_dir (<cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/)
    - canvas_template
      (the FULL CONTENT of the selected templates/canvas.*.md)

  - The generated canvas MUST be written to disk at:
    <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/diagram.canvas


### 6) Generate and WRITE table.base (CONDITIONAL)

- If "base" is present in artifact_plan:

  #### 6.1 Comparison Base Mode (PREFERRED for comparisons)
  - If base_mode == "comparison" AND comparison_items is present and non-empty:
  - IMPORTANT:
  - If base_mode == "comparison" BUT comparison_items is missing or empty,
    this is a classification error.
  - In this case, DO NOT fall back to generic base generation.
  - The execution MUST either:
    - FAIL explicitly; OR
    - Remove "base" from artifact_plan and continue with md-only output.

    1) CREATE compare_dir:
       <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/compare/

    2) For EACH item in comparison_items:
       - Generate ONE markdown file:
         <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/compare/<slug>.md

       - Use templates/compare.item.md as a strict template.
       - Fill frontmatter fields so Base can render columns:
         - item_type: "skill"
         - name
         - 输入
         - 输出
         - 定位
         - 产物
         - 边界
         - tags (include "对比")
         - source/created/modified (from properties)

       - IMPORTANT:
         - These compare/*.md files are the "rows" of the Base.
         - Do NOT put compare rows into note.md only; they MUST exist as files.

    3) Invoke obsidian-bases skill using templates/base.comparison.prompt
       The invocation MUST include runtime context:
       - title
       - folder
       - root_dir (<cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/)
       - compare_dir (<cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/compare/)
       - properties (category/created/modified/source)

    4) The generated base MUST be written to disk at:
       <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/table.base

  #### 6.2 Generic Base Mode (fallback)
  - Else IF base_mode is NOT "comparison":
    - Invoke obsidian-bases skill using templates/base.prompt
    - The invocation MUST include runtime context:
      - title
      - folder
      - artifact_plan
      - root_dir (<cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/)

    - The generated base MUST be written to disk at:
      <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/table.base


### 7) Generate and WRITE meta.json (MANDATORY)
- Generate meta.json according to rules/output.contract.md
- Include comparison metadata when applicable:
  - base_mode
  - compare_dir
  - comparison_items
- Write meta.json to:
  <cwd>/outputs/<folder>/<title>/meta.json

### 8) Execution Summary
- Output a short summary listing generated files and their final paths

---

## File Writing Rules (CRITICAL)
- Every generated artifact MUST be written to disk.
- Outputting content only in the conversation is NOT allowed.
- Missing file writes invalidate the execution.
- Always write files relative to the current working directory, not the skill directory

---

## Hard Constraints

### General
- artifact_plan MUST include "md"
- folder MUST be from rules/folders.md
- tags count MUST be 3–8 and include at least one domain tag

### note.md
Must include:
- YAML frontmatter (tags, category, created, modified)
- Summary section
- ≥3 structured sections
- Examples (code blocks when applicable)
- ≥5 Caveats / Notes

### diagram.canvas (if generated)
- Text nodes MUST use "type":"text" and the "text" field
- MUST NOT use "label" for text nodes
- ≥6 nodes, ≥5 edges
- Must include: user request, intent classification, and persistence to root_dir

### table.base (if generated)
- For comparison mode:
  - MUST scope sources to compare_dir ONLY
  - MUST include only markdown files
  - MUST prefer frontmatter columns from compare/*.md
- For generic mode:
  - MUST scope sources to root_dir only
  - MUST exclude non-markdown files
